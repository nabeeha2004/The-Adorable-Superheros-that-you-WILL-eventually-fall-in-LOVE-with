    <h2>About BT21 characters</h2>
    <p> BT21 is a representation of BTS and the 21st century(so they could live next 100 years); a comment inspired by
      BTS's Suga aka Min Yoongi. BT21 was created by BTS members themselves during a collaborative project with Line
      Friends and the group of avatars consists of eight "charming" characters. KOYA (a Koala type animal avatar) is
      based on BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon's characteristics of being a smart, sleepyhead who symbolizes peace, serene, and
      tranquility or in other words, known as moonchild. Moreover,Koya is exceptionally bright and talented just like
      the rapper himself. RJ is a fluffy adorable alpaca created by BTS Jin aka Kim Seokjin. RJ is very loving, sweet
      and a food lover. Just like Jin, RJ is a good cook and by looking at it, you would be filled with a good appetite.
      Teeny Tiny SHOOKY is delicious like the chocolate chip cookie created by BTS Suga but what's so sweet about him is
      that he loves to pull pranks on his friends. He dislikes milk. SHOOKY's soulmate is COOKY who always sticks to its
      side all the time. MANG is a hidden beauty created by BTS J-hope aka Jung Hoseok. Mang's identity is veiled under
      the mask which would make you want to wonder about this mysterious and unique creature. Just like J-hope, MANG is
      very passionate about dancing and is gifted with cool moves and grooves. CHIMMY is a yellow puppy-like creature
      who is adored and loved by everyone, it was created by BTS Jimin aka Park Jimin. CHIMMY's signature style of
      wearing a hoodie to look cool but CHIMMY is determined to give his best and work hard towards his goals and wants.
      TATA is a definition of love and is a literal heart shaped creature created by BTS V aka Kim Taehyung. TATA is a
      crown prince of Planet BT who possesses supernatural powers and with its' hyper-elastic body it can stretch
      greatly. Just like V, TATA is passionate about loving and caring. COOKY is a bunny-like creature who seems to be
      like a cotton ball with bubbly and tenderness which is created by BTS Jungkook aka Jeon Jungkook. Don't be fooled
      by its cuteness, because it has a powerful stamina and good strength with its invisible muscles. However, it is
      true that it is playful and cool like its creator Jungkook. Lastly but not least,VAN is a guardian space robot who
      is knowledgeable about everything that goes around in the Universe. It is said to represent ARMY.</p>
